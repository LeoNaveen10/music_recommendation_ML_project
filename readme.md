Classes used in this module: 
  1) DecisionTreeClassifier
  2) test_train_split
  3) joblib
  4) exportGraphViz
   
   
    In this project I have taken a small dataset to train the model
and used the DecisionTreeClassifier class to predict the music recommandation
for the users based on the age and gender.

    I have used test_train_split class to train with 80% of the data and 
to test with the 20% of data left.

    I have used joblib class to store the trained model to remove the work
of training the model multiple times. I have used this to precist the model
that already been trained.

    ExportGraphviz method from tree class had made me to realize how the predictions
are made in the first place by DecisionTreeClassifier through graph.
